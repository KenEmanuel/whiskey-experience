Along with many species of whales, chances are you’ll see porpoises, seals and seabirds while out on the open water. The best times to see whales are in the summer and fall months, and many operators offer live commentary, local tales – even a whale sighting guarantee."

There are approximately 35 thousand golf courses in the world, only a selection of these embrace the true spirit of the game—Cape Breton is one of those places..."

            "location-details": "Cosmopolitan Bengaluru is the number one city in the Indian deep south, blessed with a benevolent climate and a burgeoning drinking, dining and shopping scene. It’s not necessarily a place you come to be wowed by world-class sights (though it has some lovely parks and striking Victorian-era architecture), but instead to experience the new modern face of India. As the hub of India’s booming IT industry, it vies with Mumbai as the nation's most progressive city, and its creature comforts can be a godsend to the weary traveller who has done the hard yards. It’s a big student town where you’ll encounter hip locals chatting in English while drinking craft beer and getting around in ’80s metal band T-shirts. The past decade has seen a mad surge of development, coupled with traffic congestion and rising pollution levels. However, it’s a city that has also taken care to preserve its green space and its colonial-era heritage. So while urbanisation continually pushes its boundaries outward, the central district (dating back to the British Raj years) remains more or less unchanged.",

Indeed, just as India itself, after six decades of notable progress, is now noted as among the global economic leaders, so too has Amrut Distilleries grown both in stature and in size. Among the earliest to enter the then arcane field of liquor making, Amrut Distilleries Limited began in 1948 under the name and style of Amrut Laboratories, with an initial investment of barely a few lakhs. The founder was the late Shri J.N. Radhakrishna, J.N.R as he is fondly called to this day. Much of this fascinating story was made possible by the resolve of successive generations of the Jagdale family to embrace value and to discount form for substance. Under the leadership of the founder, Amrut Distilleries made rapid strides to entrench itself as a significant, for many the preferred, supplier of Indian Made Liquor (IML) in the Defence Market.",
